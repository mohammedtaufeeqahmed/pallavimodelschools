                                        <ui>
                                            <li>Confident - in working with information and ideas - their own and those of others. The learners explore and evaluate ideas and arguments in a structured critical and analytical way and they communicate and defend views and opinions as well as respect those of other.</li>
                                            <li>Responsible - for themselves, responsive to and respectful of others. The learners take ownership of their learning, set targets and insist on intellectual integrity. They appreciate the importance of culture, context and community.</li>
                                            <li>Reflective – as learners, developing their ability to learn. They develop the awareness and strategies to be lifelong learners.</li>
                                            <li>Innovative – Equipped for new and future challenges. They can adapt flexibility to new situations requiring new ways of thinking.</li>
                                            <li>Engaged – intellectually and socially, ready to make a difference. They get equipped to participate constructively in society and the economy – locally, nationally and globally.</li>
                                        </ui>
