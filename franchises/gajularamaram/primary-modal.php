                                            The broad aims of Mathematics is to enable students to:

                                            This curriculum covers six main areas called ‘strands’ that work together so that science is taught holistically:

                                            Cambridge Global Perspectives will develop and embed cross-curricular skills at an earlier age, supporting them in their studies as they progress to and beyond. 
                                            Cambridge Primary is made up of a series of Challenges. There are six Challenges a year. Each Challenge is subdivided into a range of activities, and covers a range of skills. The skills are taught through a wide range of topics using a personal, local and global perspective.
