                                                    The dynamics of the “teaching-learning” process at Pallavi: What was good for us is
                                                    no longer considered apt for our children. So according to the needs of the present
                                                    generation, the teaching methodologies and techniques are tailored. With so many
                                                    advancements and competitions in today’s world, Pallavi Model School, the
                                                    top Model Schools in Gandimaisamma, molds the student to be a creative genius
                                                    with a scientific temperament, a logical thinker and an innovative entrepreneur. For
                                                    this, an atmosphere conducive to a child’s needs has to be created not only in the
                                                    classroom but also at home, to facilitate the teaching-learning process. Parental
                                                    involvement is crucial to a child’s success. The successful parent-student-teacher
                                                    triangles will go a long way in launching the child into a life that will ultimately
                                                    be of their creation. You are invited to participate in the education of your child
                                                    by reinforcing positive attitudes towards healthy learning habits.
